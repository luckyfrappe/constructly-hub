# Constructly Hub — A better way of Construction

Constructly Hub is a modern marketplace platform designed to simplify construction project management. Clients can post project requests, browse available subcontractors, and compare offers, while subcontractors can create profiles, showcase their expertise, and apply for relevant projects. The platform streamlines the entire process, making it easier for both sides to connect and collaborate effectively.

## User Experience (UX)

### Business Goals

- Provide a streamlined marketplace where construction companies can showcase their services and receive project opportunities.

- Enable clients to easily create projects, compare bids, and choose the best contractor.

- Support subcontractors with a professional online presence to attract leads and increase visibility.

- Increase engagement by guiding users toward key actions such as creating a company profile, posting a project, or submitting a bid.

### User Stories

All user stories are listed in the [**GitHub Project board**](https://github.com/users/luckyfrappe/projects/6/views/1).

## Design

### Color Scheme

![alt text](documentation/showcase/adobe.jpeg "Color theme")

This project uses a custom color palette designed to create a clean, modern, and construction-inspired aesthetic.  
The light theme is built around neutral grays and white tones to maintain clarity and readability, complemented by vibrant lime accents that reinforce the brand’s energetic and professional identity.

A full dark theme is enabled through `prefers-color-scheme: dark`, replacing lighter backgrounds with deep blue-gray tones while maintaining high contrast text for accessibility.  

Both themes share the same accent colors to keep the branding consistent across all user environments.


### Typography

The website uses Tailwind CSS’s default sans-serif font stack for all headings and body text. Tailwind’s default typography is based on modern system fonts (such as Inter, San Francisco, and Segoe UI), ensuring excellent readability, performance, and a clean, professional interface across all devices.

### Imagery

Visual content across the platform is designed to reflect the scale, professionalism, and diversity of modern construction projects.

Images were sourced from royalty-free platforms such as **Pexels**, **Unsplash**, and **Freepik**, combined with additional visual elements created in **Canva** to support consistent branding throughout the site.  

All media assets used in this project are credited at the end.

### Wireframes

This project did not require traditional hand-drawn wireframes.  
Tailwind CSS and Tailwind Plus Elements provided ready-made structural patterns that acted as the foundation for the layout. Because Tailwind enables rapid prototyping directly in the browser, most wireframing was done live in code rather than through separate sketches.  

The following visuals show the initial layout concepts and structural flow used during development:

Here is a **clean, professional, CI-friendly Deployment section** written **specifically for your project**, matching the style of the example but simplified (since you worked entirely in VS Code, not Gitpod).
It includes Heroku, Cloudinary, your exact config vars, and local setup.

Everything is written in proper Markdown so you can paste directly into your README.

---

## Deployment

The live version of Constructly Hub is deployed on **Heroku**.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses **Cloudinary** to store uploaded images because Heroku does not persist static or media files.

To use Cloudinary in your own deployment:

1. Create a Cloudinary account.
2. Go to your Dashboard and copy the **API Environment Variable**.
3. In Heroku, add this value as a Config Var under the key:

```
CLOUDINARY_URL
```

*(Do not include `CLOUDINARY_URL=` in the value — use only the URL itself.)*

---

### Heroku Deployment

Constructly Hub is deployed using **Heroku**, which runs Django apps through Gunicorn.

#### Required Heroku Config Vars

Inside **Settings → Reveal Config Vars**, set the following:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | Your own Cloudinary URL |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Automatically provided by Heroku Postgres |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Your own Django secret key |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | Gmail App Password (for email verification) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | Your domain email address (if you want email functionality) |

These environment variables correspond to the Django settings:

```py
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.getenv('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD')
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your_email_here@gmail.com'
```

---

### Required Files for Heroku

Heroku requires two files:

1. **requirements.txt** (generated with `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`)
2. **Procfile**

Your Procfile should contain:

```
web: gunicorn constructly_hub.wsgi
```

---

### Connecting Heroku to Your Repository

**Automatic Deploys**

* In Heroku → Deploy tab → Connect to GitHub → Choose your repo.
* Enable *Automatic Deploys*.

---

## Local Development

This project was fully developed in **VS Code**.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/constructly-hub.git
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create `env.py`

At the project root, create:

```py
import os

os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "your_value_here")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "your_value_here")

os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD", "your_gmail_app_password")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "your_email@gmail.com")

# Local only
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Then add `env.py` to `.gitignore`.

### 5. Run Migrations

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create Superuser (optional)

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Your project will now run at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

---

## Cloning and Forking

### Cloning

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/constructly-hub.git
```

### Forking

* Go to the repo on GitHub.
* Click **Fork**.
* This creates your own copy where you can make changes safely.

---

### Local vs Deployed Version

The **live Heroku version** includes full email verification and Cloudinary media storage.
The **local version** also supports email if valid `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` are set.

## Agile Development Process

This project followed an Agile-inspired workflow using **GitHub Projects** as the project management tool.  
While not a dedicated Agile platform, GitHub’s Kanban board was used effectively to structure and track development.

User stories, tasks, and issues were organized into columns such as **Ideas**, **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**, allowing for clear visibility of priorities and weekly progress.  

The board also served as a central hub for refining features, and planning upcoming iterations throughout the development cycle.

The full list of user stories and tasks can be viewed in the  
[GitHub Project board](documentation/showcase/agile.png).

## Testing

See **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)** for test cases, known issues, and resolved bugs.

### Content

The textual content and platform descriptions for this fictional construction marketplace were created in collaboration with AI tools. Page copy, service descriptions, and general narrative elements were written with support from ChatGPT and Gemini. Inspiration for industry terminology, workflows, and tone was taken from real construction tendering platforms and public company websites, helping shape a realistic but fictional user experience for this educational project.

### Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to my cat James, who provided emotional support and mandatory “pause the coding session” moments throughout the project. His dedication to lying on the laptop whenever I needed rest was invaluable.

A huge thank you as well to my best friend in the construction industry. His guidance, feedback, and professional knowledge were essential in shaping the concept and making the project feel grounded in real industry needs. His support was a major inspiration.
