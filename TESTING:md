### Automated Testing

Automated tools were used throughout the project to ensure code quality and accessibility.

**Google Lighthouse:**

| Page | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Landing Page |   |   |   |   |   |
<!-- | [Another Page] |   |   |   |   |   | -->
| 404 Page |   |   |   |   |   |
<!-- | 401 Page |   |   |   |   |   | -->
<!-- | 503 Page |   |   |   |   |   | -->

**HTML & CSS Validation:**  
Use the **W3C HTML** and **CSS validators** to ensure clean, semantic, and standards-compliant code.  

During HTML validation, some errors appeared in the base template related to the command and commandfor attributes used in the mobile menu button. These attributes are part of the TailwindPlus Elements component system and are not standard HTML5, so the W3C validator flags them as errors. However, they are fully supported by modern browsers and required for the mobile navigation to function correctly.

Since these attributes do not affect performance, accessibility, or user experience, the validation warnings were acknowledged and accepted as a normal consequence of using this component library. I have therefore hidden these specific warnings for future automated testing.

During validation, two warnings appeared related to imported CSS and CSS variables. These are caused by the @import "tailwindcss"; line, as Tailwind is generated dynamically and the W3C validator cannot inspect imported stylesheets or statically check CSS variables. These warnings are expected and do not affect functionality or performance.

**JavaScript Validation:**  
Validate JavaScript using **JSLint/JSHint** and fix formatting or functional issues.

**Python**

<!-- I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files. -->

**Accessibility Testing:**  
Use the **WAVE** tool to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

## Bugs

### Known Bugs
<!-- List any remaining issues that are out of scope for the current release. -->

### Solved Bugs
Prettier crash deletes staged files - removed from the set-up.

Main closing tag in footer on home page causng footer take container width. Moved main closing tag outside of footer on top. 

Login and signup pages didn’t show form errors. Fixed by adding blocks for form.non_field_errors and field-specific errors.

The JavaScript initially crashed because it tried to access a .banner element that didn’t exist on some pages, causing a null reference error. Since the code wasn’t defensive, this stopped all other scripts from running. I fixed it by adding a simple check to see if the element existed before interacting with it, allowing the rest of the JavaScript to run smoothly across all pages.

Update button for companies had a wrong attributes so Update button did not workn on iPhone.
