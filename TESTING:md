**HTML & CSS Validation:**  
Use the **W3C HTML** and **CSS validators** to ensure clean, semantic, and standards-compliant code.  

- [ ] Check HTML syntax, nesting, and semantics.
- [ ] Check CSS syntax, prefixes, and warnings.

**JavaScript Validation:**  
Validate JavaScript using **JSLint/JSHint** and fix formatting or functional issues.

**Python**

<!-- I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files. -->

**Accessibility Testing:**  
Use the **WAVE** tool to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

## Bugs

### Known Bugs
<!-- List any remaining issues that are out of scope for the current release. -->

### Solved Bugs
Prettier crash deletes staged files - removed from the set-up.

Main closing tag in footer on home page causng footer take container width. Moved main closing tag outside of footer on top. 

Login and signup pages didn’t show form errors. Fixed by adding blocks for form.non_field_errors and field-specific errors.

The JavaScript initially crashed because it tried to access a .banner element that didn’t exist on some pages, causing a null reference error. Since the code wasn’t defensive, this stopped all other scripts from running. I fixed it by adding a simple check to see if the element existed before interacting with it, allowing the rest of the JavaScript to run smoothly across all pages.

Update button for companies had a wrong attributes so Update button did not workn on iPhone.
